## Technologie

To create the front-end of my Angular application, I'm using Angular CLI version 16.2.12. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that makes it easy to create, build, and manage Angular applications. With Angular CLI, I can quickly generate components, services, modules, and more, saving me time and effort.

In addition to Angular CLI, I'm also using CSS and Bootstrap to style my application. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows me to customize the appearance of my application, while Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed components and styles that I can use to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
